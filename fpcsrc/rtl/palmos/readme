This unit contains the run time library for PalmOS.

The 68k version should be functional, was tested on
POSE emulator and real devices as well, running PalmOS 4.0.

The recommended and functional GNU binutils are available as
part of the prc-tools-remix project, which updated the old
prc-tools to be compilable with modern compilers.

The ARM version is entirely untested, and almost certainly
non functional.
